# Return Difference

An extremely simple script using Python and Pandas.

This takes two data-sets and determines leads that were on the first data-set, which are no longer on the subsequent data-set.

This is helpful because I have a DNC list to adhere to with one of my insurance carriers, however knowing what leads are no longer on that list (who were previously on it) gives me a good idea of who I can prospect that may see value in what I have to offer.
